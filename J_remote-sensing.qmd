# Patterns of Vegetation Coverage | Remote Sensing {.unnumbered}

For each of our modules we will have a project-folder with an `Rproject`, `*.qmd`-files, and sub-directories for data, scripts, and results as described in our `Rproject` Tutorial. You should have a directory on your Desktop or Documents folder on your laptop (name it something like `bi349`) as a home directory for all of our project folders this semester. 

[Download the directory for this project here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rSXc8bxk86Zgp_hPPrqjsTCQjtuOVp44?usp=drive_link), make sure the directory is unzipped and move it to your `bi328` directory. You can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`. 

Once you have opened a project you should see the project name in the top right corner^[Pro tip: If you run into issues where a quarto document won't render or file paths aren't working (especially if things were working previously) one of your first steps should be to double check that the correct `Rproj` is loaded.].

## Long-term monitoring networks with standardized sampling enable valuable insights

The National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) is a network of long-term monitoring stations with the goal of enabling a better understanding and forecasting of climate change, land use change, and impacts of invasive species on a continental scale. NEON field sites encompass 20 ecoclimate domains^[Think of the eco-domains as being very similar to the concept of partitioning the biosphere into biomes. Specifically, NEON statistically partitioned the continental US, Hawaii and Puerto Rico into eco-domains that represent distinct regions with characteristic vegetation, landforms, and ecosystem dynamics] representing distinct regions of vegetation, landforms, and ecosystem dynamics capturing the full range of US ecological & climate diversity. Each domain has at least one field site where a wide range of sensor measurements and field observations are used to generate comprehensive data on plants, animals, soil nutrients, freshwater systems, and the atmosphere using observational sampling during growing season, year-round high resolution data using automated instruments and airborne remote sensing surveys every two to five years. The goal of this long-term data collection is to capture temporal change and spatial diversity at site, regional, and continental-level scales.

Long-term monitoring networks and standardized sampling protocols as implemented in NEON contribute to the reliability, comparability, and utility of environmental and scientific data, supporting better decision-making and understanding of complex systems. Especially in the context of understanding phenomena at large temporal and spatial scales, long-term monitoring enables identification of trends and patterns over extended periods, helping researchers and policymakers understand changes and make informed decisions. Long-term data collection helps establish baseline conditions, which is essential for assessing the impact of disturbances or human activities over time. In turn, ongoing continuous monitoring then provides the ability to detect changes in environmental variables or ecosystems early on, which is crucial for addressing emerging issues or threats. Similarly, it enhances the reliability and accuracy of data by providing a comprehensive understanding of variability and reducing the impact of short-term fluctuations or anomalies.

Standardized sampling plays a critical role in long-term monitoring as it ensures consistency in data collection methods, making it easier to compare results across different studies, locations, and time periods. Specifically, the standardization allows for meaningful comparisons between different sites or regions, facilitating a broader understanding of patterns and trends on a larger scale. This contributes to the overall quality assurance of data by minimizing variations introduced by different sampling techniques or methodologies. Additionally,  standardization often leads to more efficient use of resources, as researchers can adopt established protocols rather than developing new methods for each study.

## Remote sensing enables monitoring of the Earth's surface without direct physical contact.

Remote sensing plays an increasing role in acquiring valuable information for scientific research, environmental monitoring, resource management, and decision-making at regional and global scales. This technology leverages sensors mounted to aircraft or satellites to collect data about objects or phenomena from a distance. Specifically, it allows us to observe, measure, and monitoring of the Earth's surface without direct physical contact. Remote sensing is increasingly implemented across many fields including environmental science, climate science, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and disaster management.

Specifically, spectral remote sensing allows us to detect and monitor the physical characteristics of an area by measuring the reflected and emitted radiation using aircrafts and satellites. When light encounters an object it is either absorbed, reflected, or transmitted depending on the wavelength and the object. We can use specialized sensors to determine the ratio of the amount of light (generally coming from the sun) hitting an object and the amount being reflected as a value between 0 and 1 or as a percentage. Because different objects not only reflect, absorb, or transmit light differently but reflect, absorb, or transmit *different wavelengths of light* differently we can use spectral imaging to determine unique signatures of different materials. Spectral imaging captures and processes images at multiple wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike traditional imaging, which captures information in the three spectral bands that we can see (red, green, and blue), spectral imaging systems acquire data using sensors on satellites and airplanes can detect reflectance values in a much wider range of wavelengths of light. Plants, soil, water, and other Earth surfaces have unique spectral signatures that we can use to differentiate between them. For example, plants reflect more light in the near infrared (NIR). Developed in the 1970s as a simple way to assess vegetation density and health, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most commonly used remotely sensed measure of vegetation calculated as $\frac{\text{NIR} - \text{Red}}{\text{NIR} + \text{Red}}$. Because reflectance is always positive, the equation returns values ranging from -1 to +1. As leaf density increases, NDVI becomes larger indicating a healthy, dense vegetation on the the surface.

By contrast, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) allows us to create digital elevation models that enable us to quantify topography^[Topography is the study of the shape and features of land surfaces.]. Specially, laser scanners mounted to aircraft or satellites emit infrared pulses. These reflect off object's located on the Earth's surface or the surface itself. The returned pulses are then captured and recorded by the sensors on the aircraft or satellites. Based on calculations of how long it takes for the pulse to return that account for the location of the scanner, tilt of the plane and so forth the differences in height of buildings, trees, mountains and other factors shaping the topography of the Earth's surface can be determined. While elevation is still frequently mapped using contour lines, increasingly Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) including Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), and Canopy Height Models (CHMs) are generated. DEMs encode elevation using a raster (gridded) format where each cell (pixel) represents an area on the ground and an elevation value for each pixel is stored alongside.


## Topography is an important factor shaping patterns of vegetation

Topography influences plant growth by impacting environmental filters related to hydrology, solar radiation, and soil development. Alexander von Humboldt, a German naturalist and explorer, and Aim√© Bonpland, a French botanist and physician, undertook a five-year scientific expedition to South America from 1799 to 1804. The primary purpose of their journey was to conduct extensive scientific research across the continent, studying various aspects of its geography, geology, climate, flora, and fauna. Humboldt and Bonpland traveled through territories that are now part of countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico. They made significant contributions to the fields of botany, zoology, climatology, and geography during their expedition. Humboldt, in particular, is known for his holistic approach to understanding nature, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various scientific disciplines. Their travels and subsequent publications had a profound impact on the scientific community, influencing disciplines such as ecology and biogeography. Humboldt's work laid the foundation for the study of the natural world as a complex and interconnected system.

One of the observations they made was how plant species composition changes with elevation moving up the side of Chimborazo, a volcano in Ecuador. This observation contributed to the interest in understanding the relationship of plants and their environment across scales. For example, at local scales we observe differences in plant assemblage due to shading, observations like the pattern Humboldt and Bonpland observed would be at a landscape scale and biomes define global distribution by linking typical large-scale patterns of vegetation to climate zones.

Understanding the factors that determine species distribution is critical for predicting where certain plants will thrive. Environmental filters such as soil type, availability of sun, nutrients and water, determine the suitability of a particular area for the growth of specific species. When measurements of direct filters are difficult to obtain, we can use indirect filters that are closely linked to these environmental parameters as proxies for the environmental filters with direct influence on plant growth. One commonly employed category of indirect filters includes topographic measures, which encompass features such as elevation, slope, and aspect. These topographic variables are intricately connected to essential factors like hydrology, solar radiation exposure, and soil development. By employing topographic measures as indirect filters, we can gain valuable insights into the environmental conditions influencing plant distribution across diverse landscapes, enabling the development of accurate species distribution models that aid in ecological predictions and conservation strategies.

In this module, we will leverage remote sensing data generated by NEON for sites located across the United States to explore relationships of commonly used topographic metrics and patterns of vegetation density and height.
