**Learning Objectives**

After completing this tutorial you should be able to

* describe commonly used techniques to use visualizations as a tool for misinformation
* outline a series of simple techniques to identify misinformation

(in short ... be pretty good at calling bullsh*t)

[You should have already downloaded the directory for this project here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16TMHDkBq3OAVh1LtSJBQYfzUJ4GMA_iD?usp=sharing). You can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`. 

Access the quarto document `15_misinformation.qmd` and make sure it is in your project directory. Use that file to work through this chapter - you will hand in your rendered ("knitted") `quarto` file as your homework assignment. So, first thing in the `YAML` header, change the author to your name. You will use this `quarto` document to record your answers.

For this unit, you will not need to load any R packages but do use this document take notes in the document as we discuss misinformation in general and the specific role that visualization play. Make sure that you go back and clean them up for "public consumption".


## On Liars and Bullshitters

::: {.callout-tip icon=false appearance="simple"}

|
| *There are three kinds of lies, lies, damned lies, and statistics*
| ~ probably not [Mark Twain](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/lies.htm).
|
|
| *The bullshitter is neither on the side of the true or the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all. He does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.*
| ~ Harry G. Frankfurt
|

:::

In his book 'On Bullshit', Harry G. Frankfurt distinguishes between a **liar** who knows the truth and deliberately tries to convince somebody of something that is untrue and a **bullshitter** who either does not know the truth or does not care - their focus is solely on persuading the listener. The focus of this distinction is the blatant disregard for truth and a carelessness in how data and facts are used.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this

Give a brief definition of misinformation and disinformation. Then compare these definitions with the framework of a liar vs a bullshitter and argue whether or not you agree with Harry Frankfurt that "*bullshit is the greater enemy of the truth than lies are*".

In 2015, the National Review posted what they claimed to be "the only climate change chart you need to see".

![Twitter post from the National Review depicting the "only climate change chart you need to see"](images/NationalReview.jpg)

Briefly describe the figure and state what you think the message is that the National Review was trying to convey by posting this chart. Argue whether your would classify this as misinformation or disinformation^[Remember, when you 'argue' you should always state how/why it fulfills or illustrates a definition, statement, or set of criteria.].

Climate skepticism comes in different flavors. Early misinformation campaigns were directed at outright denying that global warming is occurring and/or that increased greenhouse gas emissions are the cause, i.e. that we are observing natural climate variability and there is therefore no need for policy to regulate emissions or to change individual behavior.

Arguably, a new flavor of climate skeptics has emerged in the last years that spend less time arguing about whether or not anthropogenic climate change is happening and focus on arguing that the reaction is overblown. Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Shellenberger are very outspoken representatives for this position and focus a lot of their writing on why "climate alarmists" are not only wrong but potentially harmful.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this

Sharpen your bullshit detector by looking up either Lomborg or Shellenberger and sketch out their position, main arguments on why climate change is being overblown, and suggestions for solutions/strategies (or why proposed solutions like cutting emissions are wrong and we should be focusing on other strategies). As part of your description, figure out what their background is, i.e. what credentials do they have to position themselves as "climate experts".

Briefly discuss this brand of climate skeptics. Points for discussion could include e.g. how their brand differs from what we typically think of as climate deniers, whether you think they have some valid points/arguments, what you think makes them compelling/effective, why you think it might be easier/more difficult to refute their claims (if you disagree), would you place them in categories of misinformation, disinformation, or bullshitter, or do you think it is a valid position to hold etc.

One of the goals of this course is to equip you with a framework to be able to categorize and assess new information you encounter, or as Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it *"To be scientifically literate is to empower yourself to know when someone else is full of bullshit"*. The key term here is **to empower yourself**, i.e. develop a set of skills so that you can pro-actively and habitually assess information - in short, be bullshit resistant.

The used cars salesman principle is simple but powerful, when evaluating a source of information sk yourself four simple questions:

1. Who is telling me this?
2. How do they know it?
3. What are they trying to sell me?
4. What do they have to gain?


### If it's to good or to bad to be true - it probably is (unless it's 2020)

This principle is a close relative of *Occam's Razor*, also known as the *Law of Parsimony*. 

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this

Give a brief definition of Occam's Razor/Law of parsimony. Assess how the Law of Parsimony and the principle that claims that sound to good/bad to be true probably are can be used to identify misinformation. You may use an example if you'd like.

### Garbage in/garbage out

With ever larger and more available data sets and increasingly complex analysis it is important to not only consider the output and interpretation of an analysis and the methods used (which are becoming increasingly difficult to understand as a layperson) is only ever as good as the data set used in the first place. Consider the source of the data, sample size, how it was generated, and whether it is a legitimate comparison^[Assessing large-scale data sets and how we analyze them is as you may have noticed a central theme of this course. Consider our discussion of responsible conduct in science and the practices driving the reproducibility crisis.].


### Causation & Correlation

There are two common logical fallacies that can be used to take a relationship of two variables to infer causation - *cum hoc ergo propter hoc*^[with this, therefore because of this", i.e. correlation implies causation] and *post hoc ergo proper hoc*^[after this, therefore because of this", i.e. because something occurred first it must be causing the later].

Taking this to *ad absurdum*^[How many more fancy Latin phrases do I have up my sleeve? We shall probably never truly know... Is this an *exempli gratia* of using fancy language to obfuscate information? Possibly? Is using pretentious language and jargon also a strategy for spreading misinformation? Also difficult to tell.] we have fun examples involving [chocolate and Nobel laureates](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmon1211064) along with [storks and babies](https://web.stanford.edu/class/hrp259/2007/regression/storke.pdf). Both illustrate the fact that it is important to be careful when inferring causation, consider whether proxies are meaningful, whether there could be a common cause rather than correlation, and if there is a way to design manipulative experiments to determine causation. With increasingly large data sets it is easy to find a "signal" in a noisy data set and spin it into a story^[We will touch on this topic through the course in connection of determining whether your analysis is descriptive, inferential, or causal/mechanistic.].

### When in doubt, go to the source

In one of their exhibits, the Pacific Science Center emphasizes four principles for a lay audience to consider when engaging with "science":

* Science is meant to move slowly
* Change is a natural part of science
* Experts have different specialties
* Not all sources are trustworthy

These are important concepts to keep in mind when watching science unfold in real time and out in the open via social media, pre-prints (before peer-review) and in media outlets. It is important to [slow down](http://slow-science.org/) and give science an chance to breath and mature through discussion and testing.

::: {.column-margin}

See list of Media Outlet's ranked by quality of their [science reporting](https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/03/05/infographic-best-and-worst-science-news-sites-10948); there are several similar assessments you can use as a point of orientiation as well.

:::

"New study finds ... " makes for a great headline, though unfortunately occasionally both deliberately and unintentionally by the time the "new study" is translated into a press release and that press release is written up in the media misinformation or disinformation may have sneaked in. This may include

* cherry-picking
* over-generalizing (see `# In Mice` [examples](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inmice?lang=en) and an [article](https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/in-mice-twitter-account-hype-science-reporting/) describing the intent behind the hashtag).
* false interpretation

### Beware of misleading visualizations

We'll go into detail on this one in the next section.


## On general stratgies for unmasking manipulative visualizations

Manipulative visualization either present false data or misrepresent data to tell a specific story, i.e. they are either lying with false data or lying with truthful data. 

A good way to assess any visualization is to break it down into **content**, **structure**, and **presentation**^[There is some overlap between these categories, you can also think about how these related to the grammar of graphics in having a data set (content), mapping aesthetics and geometry both of which connect to the structure and presentation of the graph.].

### Content

The focus here is on the content itself, i.e. the data set, including how the data was generated, and what parts of the data is being presented.

Structure refers to *how* data points are encoded, i.e. what data points represent, what bin sizes are used, how axes are presented etc.^[Think about all the components of the grammar of graphics we have discussed learning how to use `ggplot`.]

### Presentation

There is some overlap between Structure and Presentation, but the focus here is more on the visualization as a whole, i.e. this includes not only "scientific-style" figures but other forms of visualization as well.

| ~ Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin

:::

The presentation for a graph can easily be used for intentional manipulation and misrepresentation of the data. 

As we have seen from examples of how visualizations are used in climate change misinformation campaigns, the choice of a scientific(ish) figure is frequently intentional - it lends gravitas to claims. This does not always mean that the visualization meets the standards for a scientific analysis.

Similarly, we have seen that photographs are powerful and can easily be used to be manipulative. Keep in mind, that just because you agree with the statement being supported by a picture that doesn't mean that picture is being used intentionally to sway you to a point.

Infographics have experienced a rapid growth in popularity in the last ten years^[Here's an [infographic](https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/social-media/rise-infographic) the rise of infographics for you to refer to.]. They are a peculiar mix of data visualization, entertainment, art, and communication. They also vary in the quality of the underlying data set, frequently lack context but feature catchy fun facts and large print key "results". When done well, they effectively communicate information - unfortunately they are also frequently used for misinformation.

Here is an example of an infographic shared by the Heartland Institute. The Heartland Institute is a conservative/libertarian public policy think tank that rejects scientific consensus on climate change and publishes a range of materials supporting climate change denial.

This is the their description

> This image contains 10,000 dots, each representing atmospheric gases.
> Nitrogen: 7,800 dots
> Oxygen: 2,100 dots
> Argon: 93 dots
> Natural Carbon Dioxide: 3 dots
> Human Carbon Dioxide Emissions: 1 dot
> Leftists claim 1 dot is going to destroy the Earth. Don't let them take away your freedoms with cries of doom and gloom!

Describe what the central message is you think they are trying to convey with this infographic and argue whether this falls in the category of misinformation or disinformation. Discuss whether you think this figure is compelling in it's design and what could make it effective in persuading viewers of their point of view.

Two types of potentially misleading figures are Ducks and Glass slippers. Frequently, they fall more into the category of Frankfurtian BS as typically the focus is on how the data is presented using specific gimmicks at the cost of carelessness towards accurately representing the data at

::: {.column-margin}

Ducks are named after [Big_Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Duck) a building shaped like a duck built to sell duck and duck eggs.

* **Ducks** are figures where the topic of the figure is reflected in the design itself, e.g. the global carbon footprint being shaped like a footprint.
* **Glass slippesr** (mis)use a very specific format meant to visualize a very specific thing (e.g. a periodic table) in an incorrect context that detracts more from the content than adds to it (and sometimes is quite confusing!)^[If you are familiar with the original version of Cinderella, the Prince and his footman take the glass slipper to all the houses in the kingdom to find his princess. The evil stepsisters chop off their toes and heel in desperation to make it fit. Why this is not in the Disney version remains a mystery. Nevertheless, Glass slipper describes desperately trying to shoehorn data into a visualization type that doesn't quite fit.].
