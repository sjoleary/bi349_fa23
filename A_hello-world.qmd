The phrase "hello world" is a popular and simple introductory program that is often used to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language. It's typically one of the first programs that people write when learning a new programming language.

It is usually a simple program that prints the text `Hellow World` to the output, typically a console or terminal window. Writing and running a "hello world" program helps beginners understand the essential steps of writing, compiling, and executing code in a specific programming language.

To create a "Hello, World!" program in R, you can use the print() function:

```
print("Hello, World!")

```
