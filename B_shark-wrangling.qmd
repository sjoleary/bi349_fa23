# Data/Shark wrangling {.unnumbered}

For each of our modules we will have a project-folder with an `Rproject`, `*.qmd`-files, and sub-directories for data, scripts, and results as described in our `Rproject` Tutorial. You should create a directory on your Desktop or Documents folder on your laptop (name it something like `bi349`) as a home directory for all of our project folders this semester. 

Download the [01_SharkNurseries](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh4mtvdii1k_vU4-mfvgIGwJsZvo8MOt?usp=sharing) project folder. Once you have downloaded it, unzip the project directory into your `bi349` directory^[On a MacOS it will automatically unzip the folder for you, you should be able to directly move the **entire unzipped directory** to your `bi349` folder. On a Windows OS you will need to right click and select `extract all` you can generally specifiy which directory you want to unzip your file into.].

Once you have done this, you can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`. 

Once you have opened a project you should see the project name in the top right corner^[Pro tip: If you run into issues where a `quarto` document won't render or file paths aren't working (especially if things were working previously) one of your first steps should be to double check that the correct `Rproj` is loaded.].


## Essential fish habitat: Shark Nurseries

The [Magnuson-Stevens Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/01/17/02-885/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-essential-fish-habitat-efh) (1996) defined essential fish habitat as "those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity", i.e. they are habitats necessary for an organism to complete their life cycle. Identifying essential fish habitats is critical for management and conservation plans because it enables policy makers to prioritize certain ecosystems.

While some elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, skates) inhabit estuaries year round, many use the estuaries for specific purposes such as feeding, mating, gestation, parturition or as nurseries and only inhabit them during specific life history stages. Estuaries are heavily impacted by humans - overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction and altered flow regimes all affect the biological communities they support.

Broadly, shark nurseries are areas where young are born and/or reside in during maturation. Typically, these would areas that provide additional protection (e.g. mangroves for hiding) and plenty of food. 

Shark Nurseries have three defining criteria[@heupelAdvancesUnderstandingRoles2018; @heupelSharkNurseryAreas2007]:

1. an area where sharks are more commonly encountered within compared to outside of.
2. an area in which Young-of-the-year (YOY)/juveniles remain in or return to for extended periods of time.
3. an area that is repeatedly used across years.

## Identifying shark nurseries on the Texas Coast

Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) defines eight major estuaries along the Texas coastline and performs regular shore-based gill net surveys for 10 week periods in April - June and September to November.

Analysis of this survey has identify eight elasmobranch species present in these ecosystems [@plumleeCommunityStructureElasmobranchs2018a]:

* Bull shark
* Bonnethead
* Cownose ray
* Blacktip shark
* Atlantic stingray
* Atlantic sharpnose shark
* Spinner shark
* Scalloped hammerhead 
* Finetooth shark
* Lemon shark

Gill nets generally exclude individuals > 2m.

More recently, a multi-year open water long-lining study targeting elasmobranchs was performed in three estuarine locations near Corpus Christi, TX that are considered putative shark nurseries. Here, the sampling period lasted from May to November [@swiftIdentificationDelineationEssential2021].

Discuss whether or not you would expect to get similar results from both studies and what factors could result in differences.

Here are some things to consider: 

* gear-bias (hook size, net-size)
* seasonality (peak use for many coastal elasmobranchs is May - Oct)
* spatial (land-based vs open ocean)

This study wanted to answer four questions to further understand whether these locations should be considered shark nurseries and therefore as essential fish habitat for specific elasmobranch species.

1. How does the composition of elasmobranch communities compare across sites?
2. How does the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) per species and life history compare across sites?
3. What do the sex ratios look like?
4. What environmental predictors can we use to predict presence of elasmobranchs?

In this module we will interact with the data set generated for this study to learn how to wrangle data sets using `R` in the `tidyverse` and then we will apply those skills to answer these questions.
