For the most part an electronic copy (on a laptop or tablet) is sufficient, if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas."

    "text": "Course Format\nThis is a lecture/lab course meeting three times a week (MWF 10:25-11:15am & 11:30am - 12:20pm). Key concepts will be introduced in reading assignments, short ‘prelab’-type tutorials, or exercises that you will be expected to complete before class.\nWhile lecture/lab time will incorporate brief refreshers and more in-depth demonstrations of some of the more complex topics (participatory code-alongs), the focus will be on applying the concepts and ‘learning by doing’ by directly applying new skills to case studies and data sets from ecology, environmental science and public health.\nBYOD: Bring your own device (to lab)\nYou are required to bring your laptop for use during class times; a tablet will not be sufficient to participate though you are welcome to bring an additional device to have an extra screen to follow along an electronic version of the lab manual. Make sure to have a power cable and/or fully charged battery! If you run into computer issues please let Dr. O’Leary know as soon as possible so we can come up with a back-up plan such as organizing a laptop to use during/outside of class time to complete activities.\nCourse Materials\nReadings will primarily assigned from Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. ” O’Reilly Media, Inc.”."

    "text": "Homework assignments\nYou will spend a significant portion of lecture/lab time working on exercises and engaging with your peers and the instructor on an individual basis to troubleshoot, clarify misunderstandings, and discuss alternative approaches to problem solve.\nMost of the exercises will be completed during lab/lecture time though occasionally you will be instructed to complete an exercise outside of. Once a module is complete you will have two days to review, synthesize, clean up/complete your code and answers and turn in the knitted document (*.html) through Canvas1. No late or incomplete homework will be accepted or receive credit.1 For example, if we wrap up a module on a Tuesday your homework will be due Thursday at 11:59pm\nYou are encouraged to work collaboratively both during/outside of class times but everyone should be submitting their own work. If you worked closely with a certain person please make a note at the beginning of your document."
