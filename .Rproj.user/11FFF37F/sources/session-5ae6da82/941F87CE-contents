# Data management using spreadsheets




**Learning Objectives**

After completing this lab you should be able to 

* apply good data entry practices to format data tables in spreadsheets to create data sets for straightforward analysis
* avoid common formatting mistakes
* perform basic quality control and data manipulation in spreadsheets
* export data from spreadsheets
* apply fundamental approaches to dealing with dates^[we will find that dates are the worst in terms of causing chaos... are they numbers? strings? categorical or continuous data?] in spreadsheets


## Wait... spreadsheets?



While we are going to use R to wrangle, manipulate, analyze and visualize data in R for a more efficient and reproducible approach compared to what can be using spreadsheets, spreadsheets are the better tool for data entry, data management, and simple quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA).

By the end of this semester you will hopefuly be a master data wrangler
