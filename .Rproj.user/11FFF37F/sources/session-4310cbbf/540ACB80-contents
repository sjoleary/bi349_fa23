# Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to our lab manual for `Data Science for a Changing Planet (Fall 2023)` - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester. For the most part an electronic copy (on a laptop or tablet) is sufficient, if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas.


## Course Format {.unnumbered}

This is a lecture/lab course meeting three times a week (MWF 10:25-11:15am & 11:30am - 12:20pm). Key concepts will be introduced in reading assignments, short ‘prelab’-type tutorials, or exercises that you will be expected to complete before class.

While lecture/lab time will incorporate brief refreshers and more in-depth demonstrations of some of the more complex topics (participatory code-alongs), the focus will be on applying the concepts and ‘learning by doing’ by directly applying new skills to case studies and data sets from ecology, environmental science and public health.


**BYOD: Bring your own device (to lab)**

You are required to bring your laptop for use during class times; a tablet will not be sufficient to participate though you are welcome to bring an additional device to have an extra screen to follow along an electronic version of the lab manual. Make sure to have a power cable and/or fully charged battery! If you run into computer issues please let Dr. O'Leary know as soon as possible so we can come up with a back-up plan such as organizing a laptop to use during/outside of class time to complete activities.
