You can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`. \n\nThere should be a file named `13_greenhouse-gases.qmd` in that project directory. Use that file to work through this tutorial - you will hand in your rendered (\"knitted\") `quarto` file as your homework assignment.

Remember to use comments to annotate your code; at minimum you should have one comment per code set^[You should do this whether you are adding code yourself or using code from our manual, even if it isn't commented in the manual... especially when the code is already included for you, add comments to describe how the function works/what it does as we introduce it during the participatory coding session so you can refer back to it.] you may of course add as many comments as you need to be able to recall what you did.

What this means is that over the history of our planet there have been times at which temperatures have been higher that what we are currently experiencing. The component that is \"unprecedented\" is the **rate** of increase and impact that is having on our planet^[We will look at examples of that impact using various data set describing change in the earth-climate system.]\n\nIn this chapter, we are going to dive into a series of data sets that will allow us to explore whether we do indeed have evidence that the climate change we are currently observing is indeed unequivocal, driven by anthropogenic effects, and unprecedented in its rate.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBefore we get started let's consider what data sets we need to investigate whether rates of temperature increase are indeed \"unprecedented\", to identify patterns of atmospheric CO2 concentrations consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change, and what we would expect our results to look like if the IPCC assessment is indeed correct in their claims.\n\nTake a few minutes to write out your thoughts for the following prompts:\n\n* what variables/measurements do we need?\n* what comparisons do we need to be able to make to determine if the rate of temperature increase is unprecedented?\n* what would patterns consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change look like?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\nWe will also need to consider limitations of our approach.

One way to fix this is to simply delete the extra line ... before you do this, remember our first module looking at data wrangling and the cardinal rules we set in place? One key principle is \"DO NOT EDIT YOUR RAW FILES\": if we want to have a reproducible workflow we should avoid manually editing our data sets. \n\nInstead use `?read_delim` to pull up the help file for the function. You should find an argument called `skip` which will let us tell the function how many extra lines there are at the beginning of the file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read csv file skipping the first line\ntemperature <- read_delim(\"data/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv\", delim = \",\", skip = 1)\n\n# check that dataframe is in order\nhead(temperature)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 19\n   Year   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec  \n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>\n1  1880 -0.18 -0.24 -0.09 -0.16 -0.1  -0.21 -0.18 -0.1  -.15  -.23  -.22  -.17 \n2  1881 -0.19 -0.14  0.03  0.05  0.06 -0.18  0    -0.04 -.15  -.22  -.18  -.07 \n3  1882  0.16  0.14  0.04 -0.17 -0.15 -0.23 -0.16 -0.07 -.14  -.24  -.17  -.36 \n4  1883 -0.29 -0.37 -0.12 -0.18 -0.17 -0.08 -0.06 -0.14 -.21  -.11  -.23  -.11 \n5  1884 -0.13 -0.08 -0.36 -0.4  -0.34 -0.36 -0.3  -0.27 -.27  -.25  -.33  -.31 \n6  1885 -0.58 -0.34 -0.27 -0.42 -0.45 -0.43 -0.34 -0.31 -.29  -.24  -.24  -.11 \n# ℹ 6 more variables: `J-D` <chr>, `D-N` <chr>, DJF <chr>, MAM <dbl>,\n#   JJA <dbl>, SON <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat seems to have done the trick!

However, temperatures have changed in earth's past, and temperatures have even been higher than what we are experiencing now. What is unprecedented is the rate at which this is occurring, at least according to the IPCC.\n\nShall we investigate?\n\nTo do this we will need to look at past climate change. The two data sets we just took a look at are measurements of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> using instrumentation, i.e. we have directly measured values for the parameters we are interested in at different points in time. Dr. Keeling was one of the first scientists to consider the importance of long-term monitoring sites. The rapid changes taking place in our environment have created a push to generate long-term data sets with a focus on making the accessible. We will take a look at some of these data sets later in this semester and you will likely use at least one of them for your own data science project.\n\nHowever, we frequently have questions that might extend beyond data sets like the two we used above.\n\nHow can we access data from before we had instrumentation? One way to do this we have to use so-called [proxy data sets](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/what-are-proxy-data).\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nIn general, a proxy is an intermediary or subsistute, i.e. it is a parameter that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation. Paleoclimatologists use preserved physical characteristics of the environment to stand in for direct measurements using instruments, typical examples would be ice cores, tree rings, ocean sediments, or fossil pollen. Briefly discuss the pros and cons of proxy data compared to direct measurements using specialized instruments.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\n\nFor a deep dive on proxy data sets and climate archives, you can check out [a detailed interactive brief on proxy data](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-proxy-data-reveals-climate-of-earths-distant-past/).\n\nFor our assessment we are going to explore proxy data derived from ice cores which next to ocean sediments give us some of the longest records of past climate conditions. \n\nHundreds of ice cores extracted from polar ice have proven valuable to understanding changes in atmospheric chemistry over pre-historic time. Here, we can make use of the fact that as the ice is formed, air bubbles are trapped. Because these air bubbles have remained frozen, they still have the same composition of gases as at the time they were trapped. The depth of an ice core is correlated to time, deeper ice is older. In other words, ice cores form an archive of atmospheric conditions over time. We can directly measure CO<sub>2</sub> from the air bubbles trapped in the ice and we can measure isotopic ratios of oxygen in the water molecules of the core to derive temperature.\n\nVostok Ice core data set has been constructed using ice cores from the Vostock research station in the Antarctica and can be access through the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/portals/CDIAC).\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the temperature data. Use the code below to read the data set that has been downloaded and placed in the `data` folder for you into `R` as a data frame^[We are using a slightly different method from before which allows us to directly download the data into our data folder. We are also using `read_table2()` from the `readr` package due to the fact that our text file is formatted using neither white space nor tabs.].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load dataset\nvostok_temp <- read_table2(\"data/vostok_temp.txt\",\n                     skip = 60,\n                     col_names = c(\"depth\", \"age_ice\", \"deuterium\", \"temperature\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nTake a look at the data set and briefly describe what data is contained in the data set (you may want to take a peak at the original text file to get a better understanding).\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\nNow we can create a plot of the temperature data over time.

How does this differ from the other time series we have plotted today?\n* Temperature is being measured by proxy by looking at differences in isotope ratios; the data file lists this information as \"Temperature variation\". What does 0C mean on this plot?\n* Consider how long glacial and interglacial periods typically last - are we currently in a glacial or interglacial period?\n* In what parts of the figure is temperature increasing/decreasing (consider slope)?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Give it a whirl\n\nNow add a trend line to our ice core temperature data and run a linear regression model.

You might want to refer back to the beginning of this section when we looked at some background information about the IPCC report, the atmospheric energy budget, formulated our central questions, thought about what data sets when can use to answer our question, and the limitations of our approach.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBefore we summarize and then interpret our results, let's re-orient ourselves to what we've done with this analysis.\n\n* Write out the central question(s) we are asking.\n* List the data sets you used to investigate and what metric you calculated for each.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\nWell-written papers frequently end their introduction section with a paragraph that summarizes what their study is investigating and how they are investigating that (set of) questions - it forms a \"bridge\" between the introduction that sets up relevant background information (why is my question important?) and the methods section which is a very detailed account of how data was acquired (experimental design), processed, and analyzed.\n\nIf you read several of these paragraphs you will realize that they all contain a statement that follows a general formula along these lines:\n\n> In this study, we investigated [CENTRAL QUESTION OR HYPOTHESIS]. To do this we used [DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPE OF DATA SET GENERATED] to [METRICS THAT WERE CALCULATED].\n\nYou should always be able to make a 2-3 sentence statement summarizing what you are investigating and how you did it, it's a good self-check that you know what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nUse your results to compare current changes over the last approx. 200 years in atmospheric and CO2 concentrations and global temperature to pre-historic changes.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n*Be strategic in how you structure your answer to put together all the parts of our analysis. For example, start with temperature and compare the rate of change you calculate for recent times to the rate of change you calculated during the more distant past (glacials/interglacials)^[Remember to include units!]. In include your own rate of change + the answers your classmates posted in the slack channel. Then make a statement about whether or not we are currently observing an \"unprecedent\" change. Then do the same for CO2 concentrations. At this point you are just summarizing and describing your results, you can make clear statements of whether or not rates are positive/negative (your variables are increasing/decreasing), and whether you see the same/opposite trends but you should not yet interpret what those results mean. This would be equivalent to the results section of a lab report or research paper.*\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nInterpret your results to assess whether recent changes in temperature are due to natural vs anthropogenic factors. For your answer consider both arguments that attribute the change to anthropogenic factors and natural fluctuations.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n*Now you are entering the interpretation/discussion component of your analysis. At this point your now what your key results are and you need to figure out what they mean; essentially you are finally getting around to answering those key questions you asked before designing your experiment/study. You are going to use your results as evidence for/support of your conclusion. This means that you need to demonstrate that your results are consistent with your conclusion. You also want to consider alternative explanations, limitations of your data etc. Of course, ideally you can exclude those based on e.g. evidence from other studies/data sets.*\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThese activities are based on the EDDIE Climate Change Module^[O'Reilly, C.M., D.C.
