You should have a directory on your Desktop or Documents folder on your laptop (name it something like `bi349`) as a home directory for all of our project folders this semester. \n\n[You should have already downloaded the project directory for this module ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sh4mtvdii1k_vU4-mfvgIGwJsZvo8MOt?usp=sharing), make sure the directory is unzipped and move it to your `bi328` directory. You can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`. \n\nOnce you have opened a project you should see the project name in the top right corner^[Pro tip: If you run into issues where a quarto document won't render or file paths aren't working (especially if things were working previously) one of your first steps should be to double check that the correct `Rproj` is loaded.].\n\nThere should be a document named `09_tidy-data.qmd` in your project directory. Use that file to work through this tutorial - you will hand in your rendered (\"knitted\") `quarto` file as your homework assignment. So, first thing in the `YAML` header, change the author to your name. You will use this `quarto` document to record your answers. Remember to use comments to annotate your code; at minimum you should have one comment per code set^[You should do this whether you are adding code yourself or using code from our manual, even if it isn't commented in the manual... especially when the code is already included for you, add comments to describe how the function works/what it does as we introduce it during the participatory coding session so you can refer back to it.] you may of course add as many comments as you need to be able to recall what you did]. Similarly, take notes in the document as we discuss discussion/reflection questions but make sure that you go back and clean them up for \"public consumption\".\n\nLet's start by loading the packages we will need for this activity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load libraries\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Producing tidy data sets\n\nThe last set of functions that we need to get comfortable with allow us to create tidy data sets. \n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nList the three characteristics of a tidy data set.

To do this we have to identify columns that will be used as the key (`cols = `) and then name the column that will hold those values (`names_to()`) and the column that will hold the value (`values_to()`).\n\nIn this case, we have made three observations about length for each specimen, in order to have rows with unique observations we want a column that identifies what type of observation was made, for example called `Measurement`. This is called the \"key\" because it allows us to \"unlock\" what type of measurement the individual observation is, i.e. this column will let us know whether an observation (row) is pre-caudal length, fork length, or stretch total length.\n\nWe will designate another column `Length` to hold the values for each measurement.\n\nWe can identify the columns that need to be gathered either by name or since we have re-arranged our dataframe so they are the last columns by column number.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy_length <- catch_length %>%\n  pivot_longer(names_to = \"Measurement\", values_to = \"Length\", cols = 5:7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBriefly outline advantages to using tidy data sets.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\nWith this data set it would be straightforward for us to e.g. calculate mean values for each length measurement by species using `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy_length %>%\n  group_by(Species, Measurement) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(Length, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 42 × 3\n# Groups:   Species [14]\n   Species                 Measurement  mean\n   <chr>                   <chr>       <dbl>\n 1 Bagre_marinus           FL           433.\n 2 Bagre_marinus           PCL          NaN \n 3 Bagre_marinus           STL          517.\n 4 Carcharhinus_brevipinna FL           644.\n 5 Carcharhinus_brevipinna PCL          583.\n 6 Carcharhinus_brevipinna STL          804.\n 7 Carcharhinus_leucas     FL           769 \n 8 Carcharhinus_leucas     PCL          691.\n 9 Carcharhinus_leucas     STL          936.\n10 Carcharhinus_limbatus   FL           613.\n# ℹ 32 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Convert a tidy data set to wide format\n\nDespite all the advantages of tidy data sets you can see from the table above that frequently when we are presenting results in a table it may be advantageous in terms of layout to have a non-tidy format. \n\nThis can be done using `pivot_wider()` which works like `pivot_longer()` but in reverse. You designate which column is the key (`names_from = `), i.e. these will become the column names in the new table. Then you need to identify which column in your current data frame contains the values that should be filled out/spread into the columns that will be generated from your key (`values_from =`).\n\nSince we don't have values for precaudal length, we probably want to use `filter()` to remove those rows first.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\nMore notes on naming things ... recall, that we said that filenames should not contain spaces or special characters? We set similar rules for naming objects. Well, column names is a similar conundrum. Including spaces or species characters as a column name creates problems when we are using functions like `select()` to subset by column name or `mutate()` to create new columns based on exisiting columns. Similarly, if the column name is a number you will have problems. If you do have unconvential column names you can rename them using `rename()` or you can use backticks and either side of the name to indicate that it is a column name.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy_length %>%\n  filter(!Measurement == \"PCL\") %>%\n  group_by(Species, Measurement) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(Length, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Measurement\", values_from = \"mean\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 14 × 3\n# Groups:   Species [14]\n   Species                       FL   STL\n   <chr>                      <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 Bagre_marinus               433.  517.\n 2 Carcharhinus_brevipinna     644.  804.\n 3 Carcharhinus_leucas         769   936.\n 4 Carcharhinus_limbatus       613.  776.\n 5 Carcharhinus_porosus        415   475 \n 6 Hypanus_americanus          NaN   954.\n 7 Hypanus_sabina              NaN   349.\n 8 Rhinoptera_bonasus          NaN   819 \n 9 Rhizoprionodon_terraenovae  412   510.\n10 Sciades_felis               299.  343.\n11 Sciaenops_ocellatus         793   932.\n12 Sphyrna_lewini              471.  628 \n13 Sphyrna_tiburo              622.  792.\n14 Synodus_foetens             173   185 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Give it a whirl\n\nCalculate the number of individuals per species caught per month in 2018 and present that data in a wide formate to make it easy to compare the number of species (species) per month (columns).
