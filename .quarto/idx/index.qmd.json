For the most part an electronic copy is sufficient^[You can go \"split screen\" on your laptop which will allow you to cut and paster code if needed or if you have a tablet you can pull up the manual there which gives you a better simultaneous viewing experience but then you cannot cut and paste text between the manual and `Rstudio`], if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas.\n\n\n## Course Format {.unnumbered}\n\nThis is a lecture/lab course meeting three times a week (MWF 10:25-11:15am & 11:30am - 12:20pm). Key concepts will be introduced in reading and annotation assignments, short ‘prelab’-type tutorials, or exercises that you will be expected to complete before class as specified on Canvas.\n\nLecture/lab time will incorporate brief refreshers and more in-depth demonstrations of some of the more complex topics (participatory code-alongs), with a the focus on applying the concepts and ‘learning by doing’ by directly applying new skills to case studies and data sets from ecology, environmental science and public health.\n\n\n## BYOD: Bring your own device (to lab) {.unnumbered}\n\nYou are required to bring your laptop for use during class times; a tablet will not be sufficient to participate though you are welcome to bring an additional device to have an extra screen to follow along an electronic version of the lab handbook. Make sure to have a power cable and/or fully charged battery! If you run into computer issues please let Dr. O'Leary know as soon as possible so we can come up with a back-up plan such as organizing a laptop to use during/outside of class time to complete activities.
