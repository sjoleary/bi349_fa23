What this means is that over the history of our planet there have been times at which temperatures have been higher that what we are currently experiencing. The component that is \"unprecedented\" is the **rate** of increase and impact that is having on our planet^[We will look at examples of that impact using various data set describing change in the earth-climate system.]\n\nIn this chapter, we are going to dive into a series of data sets that will allow us to explore whether we do indeed have evidence that the climate change we are currently observing is indeed unequivocal, driven by anthropogenic effects, and unprecedented in its rate.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBefore we get started let's consider what data sets we need to investigate whether rates of temperature increase are indeed \"unprecedented\", to identify patterns of atmospheric CO2 concentrations consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change, and what we would expect our results to look like if the IPCC assessment is indeed correct in their claims.\n\nTake a few minutes to write out your thoughts for the following prompts:\n\n* what variables/measurements do we need?\n* what comparisons do we need to be able to make to determine if the rate of temperature increase is unprecedented?\n* what would patterns consistent with anthropogenically driven climate change look like?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\nWe will also need to consider limitations of our approach.

Use the file navigation pane to navigate to the `data` folder. Clicking on the temperature file will create a pop up, select `View File` and it will pop up in the View pane in a separate tab next to your quarto pane^[Be really careful not to accidentally edit the raw data file!].\n\nSure enough there seems to be an additional line at the beginning which is probably causing the issue. One way to fix this is to simply delete the extra line ... before you do this, remember our first module looking at data wrangling and the cardinal rules we set in place? One key principle is \"DO NOT EDIT YOUR RAW FILES\": if we want to have a reproducible workflow we should avoid manually editing our data sets. \n\nInstead use `?read_delim` to pull up the help file for the function. You should find an argument called `skip` which will let us tell the function how many extra lines there are at the beginning of the file.\n\n```{r}\n\n# read csv file skipping the first line\ntemperature <- read_delim(\"data/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv\", delim = \",\", skip = 1)\n\n# check that dataframe is in order\nhead(temperature)\n\n```\n\nThat seems to have done the trick! Put that in your bag of tricks for future reference.\n\n:::\n\nNow that that is resolve, let's take a slightly more detailed look at our data set to make sure there aren't any additional changes we need to make. For example we need to determine if there are `NA` values and if they are properly formatted and we need to make sure all the columns are `numeric`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nTake a look at your data frame, and make a few notes to document what information each column contains, if anything is out of order, and ideas on how to clean up any issues you have identified.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n## Solution\n\n`NA` values have been specified as `***`, which has caused some columns to be formatted as `character` instead of `numeric`. \n\nWe can use `replace()` to search every column (we specify this using `.` instead of a specific column name) and `mutate_if()` which tells `R` to check every column and if it is a character data type (`is.character`) to convert it to numeric (`as.numeric`).\n\n```{r}\n\ntemperature <- temperature %>%\n  replace(. == \"***\", NA) %>%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.numeric)\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nNow that we are all set, let's create a plot with the yearly mean global temperature anomaly across time.

For this case we would define the rate of change as the change in temperature divided by the change in time for a certain time period. A more general definition would be that you are calculating the **slope** of the line you have fit through the data as the change-in-y divided by the change-in-x^[If you compare the two figure you should see that fitting a linear regression is an oversimplification but it will allow us to make a quantitative comparison].\n\nWe can visualize this by adding a layer to our figure using `geom_smooth()` and setting the method to `lm` (linear regression). \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\nggplot(temperature, aes(x = Year, y = as.numeric(`J-D`))) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", size = 1, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"year\", y = \"temperature anomaly [C]\",\n       title = \"Annual mean global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average.\",\n       caption = \"source: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies\")\n\n```\n\nHere is what your figure will look like with that added layer.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-temp-anom-regress\n#| fig-cap: \"Linear regression (red) for change in annual mean global surface anomaly from 1880-2021 (blue).

With `m` as the slope and `b` as the intercept to determine the rate of change; with that equation we can then determine the rate of change by extracting `m`. The larger the slope `m`, the steeper the fitted line and the more rapid the change in temperature.\n\nWe can fit the linear regression using the function `lm()`.\n\n```{r}\n\n# fit linear regression\nscore_model <- lm(`J-D` ~ Year, data = temperature)\n\n# view summary of results\nsummary(score_model)\n\n```\n\nWe are interested in the equation of the regression line, how well the data fits the line, and whether or not the regression is significant. We can use the output of the linear regression to determine that. The estimate columns shows the values for the intercept `b` and the slope `m` for the variable (in this case year).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nTake a look at your output from the linear regression model and determine what the equation for our line of best fit looks like and use this to determine the rate of change, including what the units would be.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nThe adjusted R2 value describes the proportion of variance of the dependent value explained by the independent variable.

However, temperatures have changed in earth's past, and temperatures have even been higher than what we are experiencing now. What is unprecedented is the rate at which this is occurring, at least according to the IPCC.\n\nShall we investigate?\n\nTo do this we will need to look at past climate change. The two data sets we just took a look at are measurements of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> using instrumentation, i.e. we have directly measured values for the parameters we are interested in at different points in time. Dr. Keeling was one of the first scientists to consider the importance of long-term monitoring sites. The rapid changes taking place in our environment have created a push to generate long-term data sets with a focus on making the accessible. We will take a look at some of these data sets later in this semester and you will likely use at least one of them for your own data science project.\n\nHowever, we frequently have questions that might extend beyond data sets like the two we used above.\n\nHow can we access data from before we had instrumentation? One way to do this we have to use so-called [proxy data sets](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/what-are-proxy-data).\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nIn general, a proxy is an intermediary or subsistute, i.e. it is a parameter that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation. Paleoclimatologists use preserved physical characteristics of the environment to stand in for direct measurements using instruments, typical examples would be ice cores, tree rings, ocean sediments, or fossil pollen. Briefly discuss the pros and cons of proxy data compared to direct measurements using specialized instruments.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n\n\nFor a deep dive on proxy data sets and climate archives, you can check out [a detailed interactive brief on proxy data](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-proxy-data-reveals-climate-of-earths-distant-past/).\n\nFor our assessment we are going to explore proxy data derived from ice cores which next to ocean sediments give us some of the longest records of past climate conditions. \n\nHundreds of ice cores extracted from polar ice have proven valuable to understanding changes in atmospheric chemistry over pre-historic time. Here, we can make use of the fact that as the ice is formed, air bubbles are trapped. Because these air bubbles have remained frozen, they still have the same composition of gases as at the time they were trapped. The depth of an ice core is correlated to time, deeper ice is older. In other words, ice cores form an archive of atmospheric conditions over time. We can directly measure CO<sub>2</sub> from the air bubbles trapped in the ice and we can measure isotopic ratios of oxygen in the water molecules of the core to derive temperature.\n\nVostok Ice core data set has been constructed using ice cores from the Vostock research station in the Antarctica and can be access through the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/portals/CDIAC).\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the temperature data.

How does this differ from the other time series we have plotted today?\n* Temperature is being measured by proxy by looking at differences in isotope ratios; the data file lists this information as \"Temperature variation\".

You might want to refer back to the beginning of this section when we looked at some background information about the IPCC report, the atmospheric energy budget, formulated our central questions, thought about what data sets when can use to answer our question, and the limitations of our approach.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBefore we summarize and then interpret our results, let's re-orient ourselves to what we've done with this analysis.\n\n* Write out the central question(s) we are asking.\n* List the data sets you used to investigate and what metric you calculated for each.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\nWell-written papers frequently end their introduction section with a paragraph that summarizes what their study is investigating and how they are investigating that (set of) questions - it forms a \"bridge\" between the introduction that sets up relevant background information (why is my question important?) and the methods section which is a very detailed account of how data was acquired (experimental design), processed, and analyzed.\n\nIf you read several of these paragraphs you will realize that they all contain a statement that follows a general formula along these lines:\n\n> In this study, we investigated [CENTRAL QUESTION OR HYPOTHESIS]. To do this we used [DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPE OF DATA SET GENERATED] to [METRICS THAT WERE CALCULATED].\n\nYou should always be able to make a 2-3 sentence statement summarizing what you are investigating and how you did it, it's a good self-check that you know what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nUse your results to compare current changes over the last approx. 200 years in atmospheric and CO2 concentrations and global temperature to pre-historic changes.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n*Be strategic in how you structure your answer to put together all the parts of our analysis. For example, start with temperature and compare the rate of change you calculate for recent times to the rate of change you calculated during the more distant past (glacials/interglacials)^[Remember to include units!]. In include your own rate of change + the answers your classmates posted in the slack channel. Then make a statement about whether or not we are currently observing an \"unprecedent\" change. Then do the same for CO2 concentrations. At this point you are just summarizing and describing your results, you can make clear statements of whether or not rates are positive/negative (your variables are increasing/decreasing), and whether you see the same/opposite trends but you should not yet interpret what those results mean. This would be equivalent to the results section of a lab report or research paper.*\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nInterpret your results to assess whether recent changes in temperature are due to natural vs anthropogenic factors. For your answer consider both arguments that attribute the change to anthropogenic factors and natural fluctuations.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa pen >}}   Did it!\n\n*Now you are entering the interpretation/discussion component of your analysis. At this point your now what your key results are and you need to figure out what they mean; essentially you are finally getting around to answering those key questions you asked before designing your experiment/study. You are going to use your results as evidence for/support of your conclusion. This means that you need to demonstrate that your results are consistent with your conclusion. You also want to consider alternative explanations, limitations of your data etc. Of course, ideally you can exclude those based on e.g. evidence from other studies/data sets.*\n\n[Your answer here]\n\n:::\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThese activities are based on the EDDIE Climate Change Module^[O'Reilly, C.M., D.C.
