Briefly compare and contrast these two categories by describing the data types you would expect to find in each.\n\n:::\n\n\nThe '**data - information - knowledge - wisdom pyramid**' gives us a framework to consider how data can be used to inform decision making and impact the world around us. Not until **data** is organized and processed thus adding context can we glean **information** from the signal. Additional meaning is transferred as we synthesize and further contextualize information resulting in **knowledge**.\n\nThese three categories look backwards - we describe the \"what\" and ask about the \"why\" to reveal patterns and relationships. At this point we start looking forward to determine what action(s) should be taken, we know seek to reveal principles and directions that can be applied.\n\nWe integrate knowledge across disciplines to gain **insight** and **wisdom** to further understanding of problems and derive actionable solutions. This culminates in the decision-making process resulting in change.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nThe science council defines science as the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. Compare and contrast this definition to the DIKW framework and make an argument that all science is data science.\n\n:::\n\n##  What even is data science?\n\nData science is a fuzzy term and no single definition exists. Most definitions emphasize that it is a interdisciplinary field and that it has arisen in response to the increasingly large data sets that are produced. \n\nA common way of defining data science is to describe it as being the intersection of **domain knowledge**, **statistics/mathematics**, and **computer science** - though different definitions will ascribe more importance to certain different components.\n\nOne distinction to the typical scientific process as you may have learned it to be is that a large component of data science is **hypothesis generation** through exploratory analysis rather than **hypothesis confirmation**. \n\nThe data science process generally starts by posing an interesting question and ends with visualizing and communicating the results. The key steps to the end results are **obtaining** the data, **processing** and **exploring** the data, and **modeling** the data to understand the data set and derive conclusions.\n\n## The data science process\n\n### Ask an interesting question\n\nLet's start by asking an interesting question:\n\n> Will Sasquatch by impacted by climate change?\n\nSpecifically, climate change could result in a shift in habitat availability, i.e. should we expect a species extinction because of habitat loss or a range expansion or range shift?\n\nTo do this we need to generate a species distribution model (SDM) for the Sasquatch, a large, hairy, bipedal ape-like creature found (or is it?) throughout North America^[I suppose, technically, since we were venturing into cryptozoology here it is not a species, but rather a cryptid distribution model], i.e. first we need to understand where Sasquatch are currently distributed to then assess how that might change in the future.\n\n### Get occurrence data \n\nThe first thing we need for any SDM is a data set documenting species occurrence, i.e. geo-coded observations of a given species in the wild.\n\nFour our purposes, we turn to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization ([BFRO](https://www.bfro.net/)), founded in 1995 as the \"*only scientific research organization exploring the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery*\". You can turn to their website for answers on important [FAQs](https://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=405), including 'Do Bigfoot Sasquatch bury their dead?', 'Where is the physical evidence?', 'Wasn't this all shown to be a fake?, and 'Why do you want scientists to recognize the Sasquatch as a species? Isn't it better to just leave them alone?'. Their main focus though is on compiling reports of sightings and investigating them. In other words, they have a database full of geo-coded reported sightings^[And even better, it has already been downloaded and wrangled and is accessible (with sightings through 2018) right [here](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data).].\n\nLet's read in the data and then we can take a look at the information we can glean from this data set by looking at the column names.\n\n```{r}\n\n# read data\noccurrence <- read_delim(\"data/bfro_reports_geocoded.txt\", delim = \"\\t\")\n\n```\n\n\n### Tidy, Transform & Explore the data\n\nLet's start by taking a look at our data set to determine how we need to wrangle to get the information we need process it so we can generate our species distribution model.\n\nBecause we need to be able to identify the exact locations Sasquatch occur, we are going to remove any observations that do not have latitude and longitude information.\n\n```{r}\n\n# filter NAs\noccurrence <- occurrence %>%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude),\n         !is.na(latitude))\n         \n```\n\nNext, let's consider is what geographic extent of the observations is by looking at the distributions on a map.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-map-1\n#| fig-cap: Map of Sasquatch sighting in the United States based on the BFRO database (1950 - 2021).\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 8\n\n# get minimum and maximum lat/longs\nmax.lat <- ceiling(max(occurrence$latitude))\nmin.lat <- floor(min(occurrence$latitude))\nmax.lon <- ceiling(max(occurrence$longitude))\nmin.lon <- floor(min(occurrence$longitude))\n\n# create an extent object of the range of observations\ngeo_range <- extent(x = c(min.lon, max.lon, min.lat, max.lat))\n\n# get base map\ndata(wrld_simpl)\n\n# plot the base map\nplot(wrld_simpl, \n     xlim = c(min.lon, max.lon),\n     ylim = c(min.lat, max.lat),\n     axes = TRUE, \n     col = \"grey75\")\n\n# add individual occurrences\npoints(x = occurrence$longitude, \n       y = occurrence$latitude, \n       col = \"darkorange\", \n       pch = 20, \n       cex = 0.75)\n\n# draw box around figure\nbox()\n\n```\n\nHere is an example of where domain knowledge comes in - while we are tidying and exploring the data set we need to assess whether there are artifacts our outlier data points that should be removed.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nGive a brief description of the spatial distribution of the occurrence of Sasquatch in the United States. Note areas where sightings appear to be random, clustered or more dispersed, determine if you think any points should be removed.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nDiscuss some possible explanations for the patterns you have observed to determine whether you think this data set is a reasonable representation of the ecological niche of the Sasquatch and can be used to create a species distribution model.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}\n\n## Solution\n\nGood catch - those sightings in the middle of the ocean are probably errors in the geo-coding. Further, we don't know how reliable the data for Alaska is as this data set is based on opportunistic sightings - at least for the most part, if you poke around the BFRO website you will find that people do plan expeditions.\n\n:::\n\nThe data for for observations in the lower 48 seems much more reliable, so let's restrict our data to those observations.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-map-2\n#| fig-cap: \"Map of Sasquatch sighting in the lower 48 states based on the BFRO database as (1950 - 2021).\"\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 8\n\n\n# load and filter data\noccurrence <- read_delim(\"data/bfro_reports_geocoded.txt\", delim = \"\\t\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude),\n         !is.na(latitude),\n         longitude > -130,\n         latitude < 55)\n\n# get minimum and maximum lat/longs\nmax.lat <- ceiling(max(occurrence$latitude))\nmin.lat <- floor(min(occurrence$latitude))\nmax.lon <- ceiling(max(occurrence$longitude))\nmin.lon <- floor(min(occurrence$longitude))\n\n# create an extent object\ngeo_range <- extent(x = c(min.lon, max.lon, min.lat, max.lat))\n\n# get base map\ndata(wrld_simpl)\n\n# plot the base map\nplot(wrld_simpl, \n     xlim = c(min.lon, max.lon),\n     ylim = c(min.lat, max.lat),\n     axes = TRUE, \n     col = \"grey75\")\n\n# add individual occurrences\npoints(x = occurrence$longitude, \n       y = occurrence$latitude, \n       xlim = c(min.lon, max.lon),\n       ylim = c(min.lat, max.lat),\n       col = \"darkorange\", \n       pch = 20, \n       cex = 0.75)\n\n# draw box around figure\nbox()\n\n```\n\nThis should work - on to the next step!\n\n\n### Get more data\n\nOccurrence data along will not allow us to build a species distribution model; what we need is environmental data to go with the locations, i.e. we need a set of predictor variables. \n\nCombining multiple data sets is typical for data science projects, frequently the quality of a project hinges on the availability of hight quality data sets that can provide information to describe or preodict behavior if the data set you are exploring.\n\nClimate is complex and multidimensional, though at its core climate is determined by [long-term patterns in mean and variability of temperature and precipitation](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/envirobiology/chapter/3-3-terrestrial-biomes/). \n\nWe are going to use the bioclim data set from [CliMond](https://www.climond.org/BioclimRegistry.aspx#Table1). Bioclim variables are commonly used for species distribution modeling as they are based on long-term trends (as opposed to e.g. the exact conditions when the species was observed). \n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nLook up the descriptions of the [bioclim variables](https://www.climond.org/BioclimRegistry.aspx#Table1) and give a brief description of the four abiotic parameters that are included and how they are being parameterized. Argue which you think are most important to describe a species distribution/ecological niche and whether you think overall this data set will help us understand Sasquatch species distribution.\n\n:::\n\nThe data set we are using includes a core set of 19 variables that describe temperature and precipitation, along with an additional 16 variables that describe solar radiation and soil moisture. This information is encoded in the raster files of the historical (contemporary) bioclim data sets at a resolution of 10' (minutes) into the data folder. The \"historical\" data set consists of data from 1961 - 1990 centered on 1975. \n\nA raster file is an image file consisting of pixels with data associated with it. In this case, our \"pixels\" are 10' x 10' and depending on the layer the value associated with each pixel is the value for that bioclim value at that geographic location.\n\n```{r}\n\n# get list of files\nfiles <- list.files(\"data/\", pattern='^CM10_1975H', full.names=TRUE )\n\n# import and convert to raster stack\npredictors <- stack(files)\n\n```\n\nWe have now created an object that at its core consists of a list where each element is a layer (bioclim variable raster).\n\n### Tidy, transform & explore the data (again)\n\nLet's plot the first bioclim variable (Bio01, annual mean temperature).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-predictor\n#| fig-cap: Global distribution of annual mean temperature (1961 - 1990, centered on 1975).\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 8\n\nplot(predictors@layers[[1]])\n\n```\n\nWe see the pattern we would intuitively expect, with temperatures decreasing as you move poleward and being warmest around the poles.\n\nLet's extract the values for each bioclim variable at our occurrence points (observations).\n\n```{r}\n\n# create df with just xy coordinates\nxy <- occurrence %>%\n  dplyr::select(longitude, latitude)\n\n# crop bioclim data to geographic range\ncropped_predictors <- crop(x = predictors, y = geo_range)\n\n# extract values\npresence <- raster::extract(cropped_predictors, xy)\n\n```\n\nLet's take a quick look at the first few rows and columns of the matrix we just created.\n\n```{r}\n\nhead(presence[,1:3])\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nBriefly state what these values represent.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Create species distribution model\n\nOur next step is to fit a bioclim model to the data set we just generated.\n\n```{r}\n\n# fit bioclim model\nmodel.fit <- bioclim(presence)\n\n```\n\nThe bioclim model is a classic climate-envelope-model^[You may remember reading about this in your reading assignments.]. \n\nBriefly, the algorithm computes the similarity of locations by comparing the value of each environmental variables being used (our bioclim data set) to a distribution of that values at all locations with known presence^[Also called the training sites; these are our occurrence points.]. The closer that value is to the median (50th percentile), the more suitable that location is assumed to be. Suitability scores are between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a \"perfect suitability\".)\n\nIn general, there is no distinction between the tails of the distribution (i.e. the 90th and 10th percentile are equivalent), though in some implementations you can specify those to be treated as distinct. As a result e.g. low levels of precipitation could be limiting but high levels would not be.\n\nFinally, we will use our suitability scores and the bioclim raster data set to generate a predictive map of the Sasquatch species distribution. This means that the algorithm will assign a suitability score to each pixel based on the model and create a new raster layer.\n\n```{r}\n\n# generate raster with predicted distribution\nprediction <- dismo::predict(x = cropped_predictors, \n                             object = model.fit,\n                             ext = geo_range)\n\n```\n\nLet's plot our species distribution map.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-sdm-current\n#| fig-cap: Species distribution model for Sasquatch. Color indicates the probability of encountering Sasquatch in the lower 48 states based on habitat suitability.\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 8\n\n# plot model probabilities\nplot(prediction,\n     xlim = c(min.lon, max.lon),\n     ylim = c(min.lat, max.lat),\n     axes = TRUE)\n\n# add map\nplot(wrld_simpl, add = TRUE, border = \"black\")\n\n# draw box around it\nbox()\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nGive a brief description of the habitat suitability map, including the maximum probabilities. Describe wether this result fits your expectations based on the distribution map of reports we looked at earlier. According to our map, if you were planning a Sasquatch research trip, where would you be headed?\n\n:::\n\nOur highest habitat suitability values (probability of occurring) seem pretty low. One reason for this is that we used presence-only data.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nThe alternative to presence-only models is to have presence-absence data. Discuss how this would improve the models. Argue why you think presence-only data sets are easier to generate.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nA work-around of not having absence data is to generate pseudo-absence data. This is done by generating random points within the geographic range and using those as proxies for absence data. Briefly argue the merits and limitations of such an approach.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Model future climate change\n\nProjections of future climate change are heavily dependent on human activity and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore the IPCC's Assessment Reports contain scenario families that represent projected climate conditions based on emission scenarios resulting from future technological and economic development as defined by each scenario.\n\nLet's look at how the species distribution map might change in response to a shift in environmental parameters.\n\nTo do this we will use bioclim raster files for 2100 generated using the A1B and A2 scenarios. \n\nThe A1 climate scenarios assume a more integrated world characterized by rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks at 9 billion (2050) and the gradually declines, rapid spread of new/efficient technologies, and a convergent world characterized by extensive worldwide social and cultural interactions. Scenario A1B further assumes a balanced emphasis on fossil and non-fossil fuels. \n\nBy contrast, A2 scenarios assume a more divided world consisting of independently operating and self-reliant nations and regionally-oriented economic development. The population is assumed to continuously grow. Finally, this scenario is characterized by high emissions.\n\nLet's start with the **A1 climate scenario** to create our species distribution model.\n\n```{r}\n\n# get list of files\nfiles <- list.files(\"data/\", pattern='^CM10_2100_A1B', full.names=TRUE )\n\n# import and convert to raster stack\npredictors_A1 <- stack(files)\n\n```\n\nNow let's fit our model and create predictive map.\n\n```{r}\n\n# create df with just xy coordinates\nxy <- occurrence %>%\n  select(longitude, latitude)\n\n# crop bioclim data to geographic range\ncropped_predictors <- crop(x = predictors_A1, y = geo_range)\n\n# extract values\npresence <- raster::extract(cropped_predictors, xy)\n\n# fit the bioclim model\nmodel.fit <- bioclim(presence)\n\n# create raster layer of predicted distribution\nprediction <- dismo::predict(x = cropped_predictors, \n                             object = model.fit,\n                             ext = geo_range)\n\n```\n\nFinally, let's plot our species distribution map.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-sdm-A1\n#| fig-cap: Predicted species distribution for Sasquatch in the lower 48 in 2100 (climate scenario A1B).

Describe whether this fit your expectations based on the change in bioclim variables. Describe the shift in habitat suitability relative to our current model.\n\n:::\n\nHow about our A2 climate scenario?\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-sdm-A2\n#| fig-cap: Predicted species distribution for Sasquatch in the lower 48 in 2100 (climate scenario A2).

Comment on whether you expected to see greater or smaller difference to the other future climate prediction based on the scenarios that they are based on.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## {{< fa clipboard-question >}}   Consider this\n\nDiscuss whether you think bioclim variables are good models to predict a species' respone to climate change. In your discussion consider how future bioclim data sets are generated, as well as, whether abiotic conditions along will determine range changes.\n\n:::\n\n## Visualize and Communicate your results\n\nPrinting our maps side by side for better comparison would be a good way to visualize and communicate our results. We would probably include a discussion of our our approach (we should probably validate our model too which we haven't done here) and make recommendations based on our findings.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSince I'm not the first person to create a lab/tutorial on species distribution modeling, I drew inspiration from various educators, R and data enthusiasts to shape this tutorial, most notably:\n\nAnna L.
